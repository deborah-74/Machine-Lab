In line with the UAE-theme for this project, my idea is to design a clock/automata based on one of the most famous buildings in the UAE. My plan is to split the building into parts that could move up and down using a motor attached to some cams. Then, every hour, the movements could speed up to be much faster and the doors could flap open and closed. I think for the doors, I will use servos that would move the doors back and forth
