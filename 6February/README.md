## Hand Crank Mechanism

### Overview

For this assignment, I had to use cardboard, a hot-glue gun and other materials to design a hand crank mechanism that includes a cam and a slider. The last part of the assingment was to successfully attach a motor to the mechanism and have it run for 60 seconds without failing. Below is a video demonstrating this:

### Challenge One

When I created the cam mechanism, it successfully moved the cam upwards, but gravity wasn't enough to make the cam fall back down and it got stuck. I realised that adding weights would allow the follower to move downwards, but it was hard to think of something heavy enough and small enough to attach as a weight to the follower. After looking through the IM lab, I found some bolts that worked perfectly when I stuck them to the follower. This completely fixed that problem!

### Challenge Two

Another issue I faced was the cam moving sideways from underneath the follower. Professor solved this problem using some bottle caps, but I couldn't use this method because the stick the cam was attached to was extremely thick. I ended up using cardboard and attaching it to both sides of the stick to prevent the follower from moving from the perfect position.

### Challenge Three

I had some issues designing the crank mechanism - I initially made the mistake of using hot glue to stick the connecting rod to the slider, meaning that the slider rotated with the connecting rod instead of simply moving back and forth. So I had to take it apart and start again, making sure not to stick the connecting rod to the slider and instead attach them using a toothpick.
