# Ocean Clock Idea

My idea for a clock is combines a clock with ocean-inspired automata. The idea is to have wooden pieces like: fish, bubbles, corals and so on, which are attached to cams so that they can rotate/ move up and down. I also thought it would be cool to have a large wave pop out of a compartment at the beginning of each hour. To help tell the time, I could have four LEDs that could each light up based on the current quadrant of the hour we are in.
